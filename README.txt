This program is given in the book "Common LISP: A Gentle Introduction
to Symbolic Computation" by David S. Touretzky.  I modified it by
adding documentation strings and clearing the syntax, etc.  It contains three
user-level functions SDRAW, SDRAW-LOOP and SCRAWL.  SDRAW takes a list
as input and draws corresponding cons cell diagram.  SDRAW-LOOP
implements a REPL similar to the Common LISP REPL and SCRAWL is used
to "crawl around" the list structure interactively.

This generic version will work in any legal implementation of Common
LISP.
